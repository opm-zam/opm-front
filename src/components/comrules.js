Our Community Rules serve as a guideline for both shoppers and sellers in order to maintain a safe environment for on-the-go shopping and selling.

        <h3>The Do's</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Sell, NOT Advertise</h4>
                <p>
                    OPM: Online Public Market is not a platform for advertisements, but rather a forum to facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers.  On OPM: Online Public Market, you should only list things that you intend to sell.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Here are some advertising examples:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Including a link to a different website on your product page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Any content in your product description and/or photographs reminding buyers that they can contact you through other channels like WhatsApp or Facebook.  (We recognize the importance of communication between buyers and sellers, and the Chat Now feature in OPM: Online Public Market makes it simple for both parties to interact!)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><h4>Make your ad stand out.</h4>
                <p>
                    A listing with poor quality images will not attract a buyer.  Check out our recommendations below to show off your photography talents and make some high-quality images.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apart from that, be truthful!  Give your goods a thorough and accurate description.  When it comes to making a purchase, no one wants a terrible surprise.  Being honest will boost your chances of receiving great feedback from your customers.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><h4>Be respectful</h4>
                <p>
                    We want to create a safe atmosphere for consumers to purchase on their phones.  Keep your content clean and appropriate for all audiences.  This includes no profanity, hate mail, or spam.  As a community in OPM: Online Public Market, we encourage all users to be courteous and respectful to one another.  Follow these principles, whether you're a buyer or a vendor, to ensure a seamless transaction for everyone!
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><h4>Maintain a strong sales record</h4>
                <p>
                    Being attentive and sensitive to your buyers' demands can help you create a positive client experience.  Buyers who are pleased with their purchase are more likely to return and give you a positive seller rating.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maintain a clean selling record by keeping enough stock on hand and shipping orders on time to avoid unwanted cancellations, returns, and refunds.  To ensure that all users have a positive experience, OPM: Online Public Market may issue a warning to sellers who have a bad track record of selling.  OPM: Online Public Market may also eliminate certain selling rights (e.g., free delivery, preferred seller), lower the search ranking of your products, limit, or suspend your account access in some situations.
