        <p><b>Step 1</b> <br/> Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat until it starts to shimmer.<br/> Add drumsticks and cook until brown on all sides, 4 to 6 minutes.<br/>  Transfer to a plate. Add thighs to the pot and cook until browned,<br/>  about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to the plate with the drumsticks.</p>
        <br/> 
        <p><b>Step 2</b> <br/>  Add onion, garlic, bay leaves and peppercorns to the pot;<br/>  cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic just begins to brown, <br/> about 3 minutes. Add vinegar and soy sauce and bring to a simmer, <br/> scraping up any browned bits. Return the chicken to the pot and turn to coat with the sauce.<br/>  Reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer, cover and cook, stirring occasionally,<br/>  until the chicken is very tender, about 1 hour.</p>
        <br/> 
        <p><b>Step 3</b> <br/> Transfer the chicken to a clean plate and cover loosely with foil to keep warm.<br/>  Bring the sauce to a boil and cook, stirring often,<br/>  until reduced by about one-third, 3 to 5 minutes. <br/> Serve the chicken with the sauce.</p></div>

It is fresh, light and less sharp than other vinegars.<br/> Find it at Asian markets or online.</p>
